## Description
This code is a Streamlit web application designed to help users plan a nutritionally balanced meal at McDonald's. The application takes user input for various nutrition constraints, filters McDonald's menu items based on these constraints, and recommends a set of menu items that best match the user's preferences. The recommendations are then visualized through a table and a bar plot showing the nutrition information of the recommended items.

## Key Features
- Optimizes McDonald's menu items to meet user-defined nutritional constraints.
- Allows customization of constraints for maximum/minimum values for total fat, saturated fat, sugar, carbohydrates, and protein.
- Visualizes the optimized meal plan using a bar plot.
- Provides insight into the nutritional content of the meal.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit for the user interface
- Matplotlib.pyplot for visualizations
- Seaborn for statistical data visualization
- Pandas for data manipulation
