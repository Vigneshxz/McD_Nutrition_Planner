This code is a Streamlit web application designed to help users plan a nutritionally balanced meal at McDonald's. The application takes user input for various nutrition constraints, filters McDonald's menu items based on these constraints, and recommends a set of menu items that best match the user's preferences. The recommendations are then visualized through a table and a bar plot showing the nutrition information of the recommended items.
